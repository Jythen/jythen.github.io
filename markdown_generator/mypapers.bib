abstract = {The aging of the population is leading to an increase in the number of people with loss of autonomy, placing a strain on the health care system. Its prevention at early stages such as the frailty stage would allow an improvement in the quality of life of seniors while limiting health care expenses. The “Atout Age” prevention program set up by the health public authorities of Reunion Island for retired people and the new frailty assessment tools based on mathematical machine learning algorithms could improve the ambulatory care of senior citizens. At present, referral care remains hospital with comprehensive geriatric assessment and there is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of a prevention pathway for loss of autonomy in primary care. For these reasons, the 5P program “Personalized and Participative Primary Prevention Pathway” has been started in order to obtain scientific evidence. In this article, we present the objectives, design and first results, used in the 5P program up to the implementation of a clinical trial in general practice. The program is articulated in 3 phases. A first phase to evaluate the acceptability of innovative screening tools for frailty. A second pilot phase evaluates the feasibility of a large-scale ambulatory clinical trial in general practice. The last phase described in this article, is a multisite, pseudo-randomized, controlled clinical trial measuring the impact of the “Atout Age” workshops on the physical performance and the quality of life of seniors compared with their usual ambulatory follow-up.}

	abstract = "{The quantification of human perception through the study of psychometric functions Ψ is one of the pillars of experimental psychophysics. In particular, the evaluation of the threshold is at the heart of many neuroscience and cognitive psychology studies, and a wide range of adaptive procedures has been developed to improve its estimation. However, these procedures are often implicitly based on different mathematical assumptions on the psychometric function, and unfortunately, these assumptions cannot always be validated prior to data collection. This raises questions about the accuracy of the estimator produced using the different procedures. In the study we examine in this letter, we compare five adaptive procedures commonly used in psychophysics to estimate the threshold: Dichotomous Optimistic Search (DOS), Staircase, PsiMethod, Gaussian Processes, and QuestPlus. These procedures range from model-based methods, such as the PsiMethod, which relies on strong assumptions regarding the shape of Ψ, to model-free methods, such as DOS, for which assumptions are minimal. The comparisons are performed using simulations of multiple experiments, with psychometric functions of various complexity. The results show that while model-based methods perform well when Ψ is an ideal psychometric function, model-free methods rapidly outshine them when Ψ deviates from this model, as, for instance, when Ψ is a beta cumulative distribution function. Our results highlight the importance of carefully choosing the most appropriate method depending on the context.}",
